# Arkanoid_game

assigment of first year of studies. while learning OOP principles
this game was built step by step and it took an whole semester.
first i started with simple classes and objects, then after learning about inheritance, listeners, and much more,
the attitude has changed, so the code and my coding style.
the result is a very cute and nice game, and more important - a great learning process and a good understanding of OOP principles.
